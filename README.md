### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  I am a full-stack developer with a curiosity for all facets of development but a slight lean towards the front-end and a recently-founded interest in UI/UX. I have been steadily growing a passion for full-stack development after the realization that there are few to no other fields that have your logic and creativity connect in so many ways. My original educational background was in chemical engineering but I quickly found that the empirical nature of material sciences was personally not something I could see my future in. Software development, on the other hand, provides me with a stimulating feeling and a desire to explore different approaches whenever I think of a unique way to solve a problem or utilize data in a creative manner. 

  Over the course of the last six months, I have been given the chance to constantly learn/apply new languages and frameworks thanks to my experience of the App Academy coding camp. Through building 3 websites, I have realized the daunting yet incredibly exciting part of coding which is that there is no ceiling in either learning or creativity. I am excited to see what further capabilities I can unlock with so much yet to learn. My next step will be finding a career in development, surrounding myself with others who I can grow and collaborate with to build something amazing. Please check out my personal projects in my pins and look out for bigger things coming soon.
